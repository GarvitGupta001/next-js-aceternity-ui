# First Next.js App

This is my very first project using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The project is entirely frontend-based and was created as part of my journey to learn the basics of modern web development.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- **Next.js Structure:**  
  I explored the basic structure of a Next.js app, including the `app` directory, routing, and how pages and layouts work.
- **Routing:**  
  I learned how to set up and navigate between different routes in a Next.js project.
- **TypeScript Basics:**  
  This was my first time using TypeScript. I got hands-on experience with type annotations, interfaces, and the benefits of type safety in React components.
- **Component Libraries:**  
  I used components from Acertinity UI (or a similar UI library) to build a visually appealing interface and learned how to integrate third-party UI components.
- **Frontend Focus:**  
  The project is purely frontend, with no backend or API integration.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```
src/
  app/           # Main app directory (routing, pages, layout)
  components/    # Reusable React components (Navbar, HeroSection, etc.)
    ui/          # UI-specific components and effects
  data/          # (If used) Static data for the app
  utils/         # (If used) Utility functions
public/          # Static assets (images, favicon, etc.)
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI:** Acertinity UI components (or similar)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Other:** React 19

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## 📚 Notes

- This project is a learning exercise and may not follow all best practices.
- All code is written in TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
- The UI is built using pre-made components to focus on learning structure and logic.
